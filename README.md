# Challenge Earth: Sustainable City Simulation

Welcome to the repository for **Challenge Earth**, a simulation game created by **Back2Space**. This project is designed to teach students about the complexities of sustainable city-building, directly inspired by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically focusing on Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11). In this simulation, students take on the role of city planners, tasked with balancing sustainability and economic growth in an ever-evolving urban environment. 

## Inspiration 💭
Our team is driven by the need to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application. We aim to create an engaging educational tool that helps students understand the real-world consequences of urban planning decisions—such as building affordable housing or implementing green energy initiatives—through hands-on learning.

## What it does 🖥
**Challenge Earth** is a decision-based simulation where students manage a fictional city over several rounds. Each decision they make impacts key areas like public transport, housing, green spaces, waste management, and energy production. The game measures these impacts using a sustainability index based on NASA’s Environmental Performance Index (EPI), helping students see the real-time effects of their urban planning choices. 

## Target Client 👤
- **Client:** Teachers and schools seeking interactive educational tools for teaching sustainability.
- **Users:** High school students (aged 13-17) who will learn about the trade-offs and complexities in city planning.

## What we learned 📚
Throughout this project, we’ve gained deeper insights into how to simplify complex topics like sustainability and urban planning into engaging, hands-on learning experiences. We've also explored how data-driven simulations can make abstract concepts like environmental trade-offs more tangible and meaningful for students.

## Repository Contents 📂
This repository contains the following components to help educators and developers use, modify, and expand the simulation:

- **Lesson Plan:** A structured guide for teachers to use the simulation in a classroom setting, including reflection exercises and discussion points.
- **Teacher's Guide:** Detailed instructions on how to facilitate the game and guide students through understanding the consequences of their decisions.
- **Assets Data:** Information on the different assets (public transport, housing, green spaces, etc.) used in the simulation and their real-world implications.
- **Simulation Code:** The core code that runs the simulation, allowing for modification and expansion.
- **Data Model:** The sustainability index model based on NASA’s Environmental Performance Index (EPI) to calculate the effects of player decisions.

## Pitch Overview 🎙
Challenge Earth is more than just a game—it's a learning tool designed to foster critical thinking about sustainability. Students today face abstract discussions about sustainability, but with Challenge Earth, they can directly see the impact of their choices. 

Through seven rounds of decision-making, students will allocate resources, develop infrastructure, and adjust city planning to maintain a balance between sustainability and growth. Each decision has both immediate and long-term consequences on their city’s sustainability index, showing students the complexities faced by real-world planners.

With scalability in mind, Challenge Earth can be adapted to focus on other SDGs by modifying the in-game assets. This makes the tool not only relevant for the current topic but expandable for future education around global sustainability challenges.

We hope this tool will become a valuable part of classrooms worldwide, fostering the next generation of responsible, informed citizens.
